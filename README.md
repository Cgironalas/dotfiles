A repository of configuration files for various programs I use.  
They will be based on [Samuel Roeca's dotfiles](https://github.com/pappasam/dotfiles).

To backup your dotfiles and link the ones available from this git run
`make dotfiles`.

To remove this git's dotfiles and restore yours run `make clean`.
